Q: Please modify main.s to observe the `push` and the `pop` instructions:  

	Does the order of the registers in the `push` and the `pop` instructions affect the excution results?  

	For example, will `push {r0, r1, r2}` and `push {r2, r0, r1}` act in the same way?  

	Which register will be pushed into the stack first?
